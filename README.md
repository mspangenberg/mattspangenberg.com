The HTML5 Boilerplate website is a simple static site.

* The development code is in the
  [`src`](https://github.com/h5bp/html5boilerplate.com/tree/master/src)
  directory.
* The build process relies on [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) (a
  [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) task runner).
* The Grunt configurations can be found in the
  [`Gruntfile.js`](https://github.com/h5bp/html5boilerplate.com/blob/master/Gruntfile.js)
  file.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/download/).
2. [Install Grunt's command line interface (CLI)
   globally](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli):
   `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Run `npm install` in the repository.

## Development

You should be able to work almost entirely in the
[`src`](https://github.com/mspangenberg/su-style-guide/tree/master/src) directory.

While developing run `grunt dev; grunt watch` as this will automatically update it whenever 
changes are made to the page or any of the files contained in the page. You will need to open
the index after it is built from the dist folder directory.


## Build

When you have finished your changes, make sure that the distribution package is
correct by running `grunt test` and then checking the output.

## Deploy

This step is done automatically: the server will
[periodically pull](https://github.com/h5bp/html5boilerplate.com/wiki) from
the `server-content` branch, branch that will be updated by Travis CI every
time a commit is pushed to the `master` branch and the tests pass.
